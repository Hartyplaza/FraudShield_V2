"""
src/features/label_simulator.py

Deterministic fraud label simulation using conjunctive signal rules.

Three rules — each requires multiple signals to fire together:
    Rule A: Night + High amount + Risky transaction type
    Rule B: Night + High amount + Missing location
    Rule C: High amount + Device switch + Missing location

No randomness — identical features always produce identical labels.
This eliminates label noise and gives the model a clean learnable boundary.
