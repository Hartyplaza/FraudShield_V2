Feature engineering pipeline for fraud detection.
Builds 28 features across 6 groups from the cleaned, labelled DataFrame.

Feature groups:
    1. Temporal          - hour, day_of_week, is_night, is_weekend, is_business_hours
    2. Amount            - z-score, high_amount flag, ratio to user max
    3. Velocity          - rolling txn count and sum over 1d, 7d, 30d windows
    4. Behavioural       - device switch, location switch, time since last txn
    5. Missing flags     - location_missing, device_missing
    6. Categorical codes - txn_type, location, device, log_format, currency
